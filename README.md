# Fashion MNIST Image Classification with CNN

## Description

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It shows how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model to recognize different clothing items.

## Features

*   **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loads and normalizes the Fashion MNIST dataset.
*   **CNN Model Architecture**: Defines a simple yet effective CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
*   **Model Training**: Trains the CNN model on the training dataset.
*   **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance on the test dataset.
*   **Prediction Visualization**: Displays sample test images with their true and predicted labels.
